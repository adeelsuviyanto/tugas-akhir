  abstract = {Ensuring the desired level of security is an important issue in all communicating systems, and it becomes more challenging in wireless environments. Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) are an emerging type of mobile network that is built using energy-restricted devices. Hence, the communications interface used and that computation complexity are additional factors to consider when designing secure protocols for these networks. In the literature, various solutions have been proposed to ensure secure and reliable internode communications, and these FANET nodes are known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In general, these UAVs are often detected as malicious due to an unintentional misbehavior related to the physical features of the UAVs, the communication mediums, or the network interface. In this paper, we propose a new context-aware trust-based solution to distinguish between intentional and unintentional UAV misbehavior. The main goal is to minimize the generated error ratio while meeting the desired security levels. Our proposal simultaneously establishes the inter-UAV trust and estimates the current context in terms of UAV energy, mobility pattern, and enqueued packets, in order to ensure full context awareness in the overall honesty evaluation. In addition, based on computed trust and context metrics, we also propose a new inter-UAV packet delivery strategy. Simulations conducted using NS2.35 evidence the efficiency of our proposal, called , at ensuring high detection ratios {$>$} 87\% and high accuracy with reduced end-to-end delay, clearly outperforming previous proposals known as , -, and .},

  abstract = {In recent years, FANET-related research and development has doubled, due to the increased demands of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in both military and civilian operations. Equipped with more capabilities and unique characteristics, FANET is able to play a vital role in mission-critical applications. However, these distinctive features enforce a series of guidelines to be considered for its efficient deployment. Particularly, the use of FANET for on-time data communication services presents demanding challenges in terms of energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS). Proper use of communication architecture and wireless technology will assist to solve these challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we review different communication architectures, including the existing wireless technologies, in order to provide seamless wireless connectivity. Based on the discussions, we conclude that a multi-layer UAV ad-hoc network is the most suitable architecture for networking a group of heterogeneous UAVs, while Bluetooth 5 (802.15.1) is the most favored option because of its low-cost, low power consumption, and longer transmission range for FANET. However, 802.15.1 has the limitation of a lower data rate as compared to Wi-Fi (802.11). Therefore, we propose a hybrid wireless communication scheme so as to utilize the features of the high data transmission rate of 802.11 and the low-power consumption of 802.15.1. The proposed scheme significantly reduces communication cost and improves the network performance in terms of throughput and delay. Further, simulation results using the Optimized Network Engineering Tool (OPNET) further support the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

Disasters create emergency situations and cause physical and social disorder. In these emergency situations, food, water, shelter, protection and medical help are needed, and the effort needed to provide these basic services to the victims must be coordinated quickly via a reliable communication network. Disaster relief operations typically involves a series of steps including establishment of communication infrastructures, performing search and rescue operations, and providing any needed first aid services. Disaster networks can be classified as disaster mitigation networks and disaster relief networks. A disaster recovery network is a network that is used in the pre-disaster stage to plan effective post-disaster relief operations.},

We also present several ideas on potential enhancements for improving LTE connectivity performance and identify fruitful avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {ABSTRAK Pada kasus bencana alam, penyebaran robot pada area bencana sangat bermanfaat bagi tim SAR dalam proses pencarian korban. Khususnya, jika robot yang disebar merupakan robot otonom untuk meningkatkan proses pencarian, secara efektif dan efisien. Pada artikel ini, kami mengusulkan sebuah robot otonom untuk pencarian korban bencana yang ditanamkan metode waypoint dengan mengeksploitasi sensor, GPS dan divais komunikasi. Hasil yang didapat menunjukkan bahwa robot ini mampu mencari korban bencana secara otonom dengan mendeteksi pergerakan kecil dan temperatur korban. Kemudian, koordinat lokasi korban dikirim ke tim SAR untuk operasi penyelamatan. Robot ini juga mampu melakukan perjalanan pulang ke posko asal untuk pengisian daya ketika daya baterainya hampir habis. Kata kunci: robot otonom, waypoint, bencana, pencarian korban, perjalanan pulang ABSTRACT In the case of disaster, the deployment of robots is immensely helpful for SAR team in the process of searching the victims. Especially, if the deployed robots are autonomous to enhance the searching process, effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we propose an autonomous robot for searching the disaster victims embedded by automatic waypoint method by exploiting sensors, GPS and communication devices. Result shows that this robot is able to search the victims autonomously by detecting their slight movement and temperature then sending the coordinates to the SAR team for the rescue operation. This robot is also able to do the return trip autonomously to the initial post for charging when its power is almost running out.
